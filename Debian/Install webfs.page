# Webfs - Web File Server

Simple Web Server to transfer files to an other computer. Specially used to transfer gps tracks to the iPhone


### Starting stopping webfs

**NOTE: Before starting the web service, change the file attributes of the files to be downloaded!!!**

     sudo /etc/init.d/webfs start
     sudo /etc/init.d/webfs stop

**NOTE: Before starting the web service, change the file attributes of the files to be downloaded!!!**


### Configuration
The config file is: /etc/webfsd.conf

* Port: 80

### Webfs installation

    sudo apt-get install webfs

The Server start automatically. To avoid this do the following

    sudo apt-get install dialog
