# Debian Hard Disk Installation

## Introduction

On new UEFI Systems, changing the HW to boot on an USB stick is not easy.

If already a Linux System is installed then this Linux can be replaced by a Debian system with a so called hard disk installation.

## Analyze current disk partitions

Use the GNU parted utility. It will analyze the first disk. 

    sudo parted

Subcommands

* print - print the current partitions
* quit - exit parted utility


* Check the partition number of the current boot partition.
* Check the file system of the current linux main partition

* Create a directory */boot/newinstall*
* Google for *hd-media/initrd.gz amd64*

* Google for a Debian netinstall iso disk image
* Download it into /boot/newinstall
