# Debian Hard Disk Installation

## Introduction

On new UEFI Systems, changing the HW to boot on an USB stick is not easy.

If already a Linux System is installed then this Linux can be replaced by a Debian system with a so called hard disk installation.

## Analyze current disk partitions

Use the GNU parted utility. It will analyze the first disk. 

    sudo parted

If there is an other disk use the disk path as arguemnt to parted eg */dev/sdb*

Subcommands

* print - print the current partitions
* quit - exit parted utility

* Note the partition number and the file system of the current boot partition.


## Download the necessary files

* Create a directory */boot/newinstall*
* Google for *hd-media/initrd.gz amd64* 
* Look for something like debian/disks/jessie/installer-amd64/current-images
* Download the files initrd.gz and vmlinuz and copy them into the new directory /boot/install
* Google for a Debian netinstall iso disk image
* Download it into /boot/newinstall

## Create input for grub2 loader

Edit the file /etc/grub.d/40_custom:

    menuentry 'Debian Installer' {
     insmod part_msdos
     insmod ext2
     set root='(hdX,gptY)'
     linux /boot/newinstall/vmlinuz
     initrd /boot/newinstall/initrd.gz
    }

* Replace *ext2* with the file system on the current /boot directory
* Replace *hdX* with *hd0* if /boot/newinstall directory is on the first disk, hd1 if it is on the second disk, etc
* Replace *gptY* with *gpt5*, if 5 is the partition number of the directory /boot/newinstall

Run the following command:

    sudo update-grub

Restart the system and in the boot menu is now a new entry!
