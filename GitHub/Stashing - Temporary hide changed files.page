# Stashing - Temporary hide changed files

Working on different branches (eg change the current working branch) sometimes requires, that changed files must be commited. It these files contain debug code, or bad code that should not be seen by others, we can use git stash.

## Stashing (Hiding) changed files

    git stash save "message"

The message should describe the changes of the files, the branch name is not necessary.

## List the available stashes

    git stash list 

## Re-apply the hidden files

    git stash apply stash@{n}

Note: The *n* is the sequence number of the *stash list* output list.

* apply - the changed files remain in the stash store.
* pop   - the changed files are deleted from the stash store.
   
## List the names of the stashed files

    git stash show stash@{n}

## List the changes in the stashed files

    git stash show stash@{n} -p
   
## Delete stashed files

    git stash drop stash@{n}
