# Dynamic

A container for a value that can change over time and allows
notifications on changes.  Basically a combination of a 'Behavior' and an
'Event', with a rule that the 'Behavior' will change if and only if the
'Event' fires.

~~~ { .haskell }
data Dynamic t :: * -> *
~~~
 


## Conversion functions

### Extract the Behavior of a Dynamic
~~~ { .haskell }
  current :: Dynamic t a -> Behavior t a
~~~

### Extract the Event of the 'Dynamic'.
~~~ { .haskell }
  updated :: Dynamic t a -> Event t a
