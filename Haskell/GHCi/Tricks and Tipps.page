# GHCi Tricks and Tipps

### Show type class functions specialized for one type class

    :set -XTypeApplications
    :type fmap @Maybe

Result:

    fmap @Maybe :: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b

Use underscore for data types with more than one polymorphic type variables

    :type fmap @(Either _)
    :type fmap @((->) _)
