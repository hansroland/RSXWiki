# Haskell Class Eq

Compare 2 values, whether they are equal.

## Definition of the Eq class in the Prelude

~~~ {.haskell}
class Eq a where
    (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    x /= y   =   not x == y
    x == y   =   not x /= y
~~~

To define a type as instance of class Eq it's only necessary to define one of the 2 functions.
Normally an instance of Eq for a type is generated by the compiler with the deriving (Eq) clause.
