# Typeclass Alternative

## Definition

Typical use: We choose one value out of two

~~~ { .haskell }
class Applicative f => Alternative f where
    -- | The identity of '<|>'
    empty :: f a
    -- | An associative binary operation
    (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
~~~

The Alternative type class defines 2 additional functions. They are mostly used in parsers:

~~~ { .haskell }
some :: f a -> f [a] 
some f = (:) <$> f <*> many f

many :: f a -> f [a] 
many f = some f <|> pure []
~~~


## Instances

### Maybe

We choose the first Non-Nothing value. 

Usage: We several computations and we return the first that succeeds!

~~~ { .haskell }
instance Alternative Maybe where
    empty = Nothing
    Nothing <|> r = r
    l       <|> _ = l
~~~ 

For the Maybe instance *some* and *many* do not make sense. They evaluate the value until it becomes false and collect the result in a list. So for non-Nothing values they loop
