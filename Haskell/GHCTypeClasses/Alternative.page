# Typeclass Alternative

## Definition

Typical use: We choose one value out of two

~~~ { .haskell }
class Applicative f => Alternative f where
    -- | The identity of '<|>'
    empty :: f a
    -- | An associative binary operation
    (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
~~~

## Instances

### Maybe

We choose the first Non-Nothing value. 

Usage: We several computations and we return the first that succeeds!

~~~ { .haskell }
instance Alternative Maybe where
    empty = Nothing
    Nothing <|> r = r
    l       <|> _ = l
~~~
