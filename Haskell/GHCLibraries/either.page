# Base Library Data.Either

## data Either a b 

The Either type represents values with two possibilities: a value of type Either a b is either Left a or Right b.

The Either type is sometimes used to represent a value which is either correct or an error; by convention, the Left constructor is used to hold an error value and the Right constructor is used to hold a correct value (mnemonic: "right" also means "correct").


## Functions

either :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c 
:    Case analysis for the Either type. If the value is Left a, apply the first function to a; if it is Right b, apply the second function to b.
