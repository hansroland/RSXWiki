# GHC Language Extensions: Type Families

## Open Type Families

Open Type Families can be extended in other modules, like you can add instances to classes in other modules.

Type Families are somehow similar to aliases. Her we map the alias *AddResult a b* to some type:

~~~ {.haskell}

{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClass #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

type family AddResult a b
type instance AddResult Double Double = Double
type instance AddResult Int Double = Double
type instance AddResult Double Int = Double
type instance AddResult Int Int = Int
~~~
