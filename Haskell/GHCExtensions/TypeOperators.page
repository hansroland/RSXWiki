# Haskell Language Extensions: TypeOperators

Type Operator allow to define operators at the type level

### Addition of Natural Numbers without TypeOperators

~~~ {.haskell}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, TypeFamilies #-}

data Nat = Z | S Nat

type family   Plus (n :: Nat) (m :: Nat) :: Nat
type instance Plus Z     m = m
type instance Plus (S n) m = S (Plus n m)
~~~

### Additon of Nautural Numbers with Type Operators

~~~ {.haskell}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, TypeFamilies, TypeOperators #-}
data Nat = Z | S Nat

infixl 6 :+

type family   (n :: Nat) :+ (m :: Nat) :: Nat
type instance Z     :+ m = m
type instance (S n) :+ m = S (n :+ m)
