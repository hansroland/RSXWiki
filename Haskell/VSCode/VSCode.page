# Visual Studio Code

## Aktivate GHCIDE

* Add a file `hie.yaml` to the home directory of the project
* Add the line `cradle: {cabal: {component: "MyProject"}}`
* Replace `MyProject` with the name of the Project (cabal name!)

Now `ghcide` should be activated, and after some time, ready to use.


## Preview Markdown Files

* Use **Ctrl+Shift+V** to preview the .md file
* Use **Ctrl+K V**     to have the preview side by side
